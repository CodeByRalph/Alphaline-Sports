      "defense": "Over 250.5 pass yards is a clean Mahomes spot. Against heavy blitz looks, he’s historically efficient and productive—about 285 yards on average—because he diagnoses pressure quickly and punishes single coverage. The Raiders’ secondary sitting 28th suggests the back end isn’t equipped to hold up if Vegas sends heat or gets forced into man coverage. Add in a fully healthy Travis Kelce, and you’ve got Mahomes’ highest-leverage chain-mover and red-zone separator back at full capacity, which extends drives and keeps the yardage accumulating. The number isn’t asking for a ceiling game; it’s asking for a normal Mahomes volume/efficiency performance. Even with a moderate lead, Kansas City typically builds it through the air early, and 251 is reachable by late third quarter.",
      "skepticQuestions": [
        "If the rain hits hard in the 2nd half, what’s the plan if Andy Reid shifts to a short-pass/run-heavy script and the average depth of target collapses?",
        "What happens if the Chiefs go up two scores early—do you still get enough fourth-quarter pass attempts, or does the game turn into clock-killing runs?",
        "If the Raiders choose a softer, two-high zone and stop blitzing to avoid getting burned, does your “285 vs heavy blitz” edge disappear and turn this into a slower, underneath game?"
      ],
      "rebuttal": "The rain and “run-if-ahead” risks are real, but this total is still in the Mahomes comfort zone. Even if the 2nd half gets messy, the Chiefs can front-load yards before weather worsens, and Mahomes’ quick game functions as an extension of the run—still counting as pass yards. A big lead doesn’t automatically kill the over either: efficient early drives can put him near 200+ by halftime, and one or two third-quarter scoring possessions can push him over 250 before the clock-management phase. Minor flaw: this bet leans on Kansas City not going ultra-conservative late. Still, the matchup plus Kelce’s health keeps me firmly on the over."

      "defense": "Over 100 pass yards is priced like a low bar, and the player’s history treats it that way. Season average is 188—almost double the line—and he’s cleared 100 in 10-of-10 games. Even his worst recent outing was 101, basically landing on the number. The matchup isn’t a trap either: Pittsburgh is giving up about 230 pass yards per game, roughly neutral, so we’re not asking him to beat an elite shutdown unit. The offensive line continuity is intact with all five expected starters, which reduces collapse risk and helps him reach a modest yardage threshold even if efficiency dips. Yes, the last three games trend down (157), and weather is cold and windy, but 100 yards is still a “get to halftime” kind of number. Projection stays above the line with moderate confidence.",
      "skepticQuestions": [
        "He’s questionable and a game-time decision with high snap volatility—what’s your plan if he’s limited, rotated, or exits early? Doesn’t that turn a safe threshold into a fragile one?",
        "Your dataset flags inconsistencies (0 game samples, placeholder averages, even listing him as an 'S'); how confident are you that the 10/10 hit rate and season average are accurate enough to anchor the bet?",
        "At 29°F with 15–18 mph wind and a modeled passing penalty, what if the game script shifts run-heavy and he only throws 15–20 passes—can he still reliably clear 100 without volume metrics like pass rate or yards per dropback?"
      ],
      "rebuttal": "The only true “kill switch” here is availability. If he’s announced active with no reported pitch count, the bar is still extremely low relative to his established baseline—he can clear 100 on routine volume. On data quality: I’ll admit the metadata issues (position tag, team sample glitches) are a minor flaw and mean we shouldn’t over-trust any single table. But the core signal is consistent across multiple references in the rationale: season yardage level and a 10-game streak above 100, with a recent floor sitting right on the line. Weather and a potential run lean lower ceiling, not necessarily a 100-yard floor. If pregame reports hint at limitation or in-game rotation risk, I’d pass; otherwise I’m still in."
